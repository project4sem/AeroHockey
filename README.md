 A game like air hockey with a description of the physics of the process
 We plan to create a game, the essence of which will be to get the puck into the right hole bypassing obstacles. In this case, we plan to write a qualitative physical description of the movement of the puck, which is a task without a common solution.
Tasks:
* **Physics** First of all, it is necessary to obtain a mathematical approximation of the movement of the puck, namely, to obtain the imperial dependences of the linear and angular velocities of the puck on time. This is planned to be made with the Wolfram Mathematica package.
* **Graphics** It is necessary to develop a graphical shell of the game, personalized user interface and to understand the principles of interaction between physics and graphics. It is planned to be implemented on the Unity engine.
